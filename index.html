        <p>Hello! My name is Kai Lelo. I am an exercise physiology student currently living in Rexburg, Idaho. I enjoy anything outdoors, specifically playing soccer and going snowboarding during the winter. I have been married for 7 months to my beautiful wife, Sarah Beth, who is from South Carolina. We have a 6 month old Goldendoodle named Rexi, named after Rexburg where we met. Currently, I work at a company called SafeStreets USA. I manage the operations within our logistics and customer service department. We are the only authorized provider for ADT Security with a customer base that spans across almost every state, including Puerto Rico. My goal is to attend grad school and become a Physical Therapist. If I follow the path of Physical Therapy, I will partner with my father to open our own clinic in Arizona. I look forward to the skills I can learn in this class as they will help me in either path that I choose to follow.</p>
